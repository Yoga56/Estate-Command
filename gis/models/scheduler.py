"""Tomorrow's assignment: which crew goes to which blocks, and why.

The question every panel in this app stops short of. Rotation says which
blocks are ripe, upkeep says which are overdue, pest says where the disease
is; none of them says what G1-03 should do at six tomorrow morning with the
twenty-one men who turn up. This module does, for six operations, from the
demand and capacity the ops layer computes.

The objective
-------------
Maximise value recovered per man-day, subject to capacity. Four terms, all
in rupiah, each traceable to a figure the app already computes:

    deferral     what leaving the block one more planning cycle would cost:
                 the ops layer's cost-per-day times the cycle length. For
                 harvest that is ripe crop losing value past the round; for
                 upkeep it is yield lost while a round is overdue.
    contiguity   a bonus for a block adjacent to one the crew already has
                 (or to its home block), as a share of the block's value.
    travel       the crew's time in transit from wherever it last was,
                 priced at the man-day cost.
    capacity     man-days the crew actually has tomorrow, from attendance.

Contiguity is not a nicety. A plan that sends a gang to blocks 12, 87 and
203 is arithmetically optimal and operationally void: nobody executes it.
The bonus is what produces "blocks 14 to 19" instead of a scattered list,
and the Why tab reports exactly what it cost by running the plan again with
the weight at zero.

The method
----------
Greedy by value density, round-robin across crews, a swap-improvement pass,
then each crew's blocks are put in a short route. Not an LP. The output has to be defended line by line to a mandor who
disagrees with it, and "this block scored higher than that one, here is the
arithmetic" survives that conversation where a simplex tableau does not.
Choosing the blocks and ordering them are separate steps: the greedy picks
blocks by value, wherever they lie, so its pick order zigzags; the route step
only reorders what a crew already has, so value recovered does not change.
The gap to a relaxed upper bound (fractional knapsack, no contiguity, no
travel) is reported so the greedy choice is accountable.

Nothing is fitted here. The model inputs are read, never trained, inside a
request: the productivity model's per-block target, and the four forecasts
of buildplan_ml.md, each behind a switch in the assumption register and each
used only where it beat the method it replaces on past days:

    rain         the chance of wash-off and of a stop, from last night's
                 forecast (gis/models/rain.py); spray-or-hold becomes a cost
                 decision
    headcount    each crew's likely turnout and range (headcount.py, read
                 through ops.capacity)
    work done    each block's expected share done; a block's deferral value
                 is discounted by it, so on a wet day gangs go to good roads
                 first (slippage.py)
    speeds       a crew's capacity and a harvest block's rate, adjusted by
                 what the ledger shows they actually do (rates.py)

Everything else is arithmetic over the ledger and the assumption register,
cached by (operation, date, overrides, assumptions).
